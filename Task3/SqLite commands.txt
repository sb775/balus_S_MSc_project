#Databases of the clusters of the antibody complementarity determinging regions (CDRs) in the PDB

#Of seven available databases, the following was downloaded.

# * Non-redundant antibody database by a single CDR, CDRs and clusters for sequences non-redundant for a given CDR type. A chain containing the CDR is selected in the order of: Highest #   resolution 2.8 Lowest R factor 0.3. Lowest normalized distance to the center structure.


# *The output has been copied and pasted into a spreadsheet: 'PyIgClassify_data.csv'.
